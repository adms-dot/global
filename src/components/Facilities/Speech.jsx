<p>If your child is not able to speak clearly, pronounce words clearly or is having communication difficulty, then speech therapy is way forward</p>

<p>At Global child wellness centre, a child has one on one session with a speech therapist who by various scientific techniques, helps a child in speech problems.</p>

<p>Our speech therapist will help kids with different kinds of speech difficulties as well as language issues like dyslexia and dyspraxia.</p>

<p>Right from a toddler who has speech delays to an adolescents who have stammering or communication problems, we offer various types of programs.</p>

<b>Some of basic programs we have for kids include:-</b>

<li>Articulation problems:Not speaking clearly and making errors in sounds.</li>
<li>Fluency problems:Trouble with the flow of speech, such as stuttering.</li>
<li>Resonance or voice problems:Trouble with voice pitch, volume and quality.</li>
<li>Oral feeding problems:Difficulty with eating, swallowing and drooling.</li>

<p>Along with speech therapy we work with the Occupational Therapist, to work on the Oro motor skills and sensory issues associated with speaking.</p>
<p>We also work in parallel with a psychologist who also works with the child for motivation enhancement. Since many children may also have an associated low self esteem, it is important to work on raising the self esteem and morale of the young persons going through these problems.</p>
<p>Each child / adolescent needs a unique management plan. We work with parents to make a plan that is customised for the needs of the child/adolescent.</p>

<b>As they say, “It takes a village to raise a child” and at GCWC we have a village…</b>

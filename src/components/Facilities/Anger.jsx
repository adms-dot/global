      <p>Anger management is a therapy by which a person remains calm and composed in tense situations and handles them in a positive and constructive way.</p>

      <p>At Global child wellness centre, we try to identify stressors and help decrease the emotional and physiological arousal. A team of therapists helps the client to control reactions and respond to a social situation in an appropriate way.</p>

     <b>Basic Causes of Anger</b>
      <li>1. Internal events such as frustration , failure or high expectations</li>
      <li>2. External events such as a financial loss or public humiliation</li>

      <b>Therapies at Global Child Wellness Centre</b>
      <p>Children can display tantrums or verbal arguments when in anger. Increased aggression is a response that helps to fight off threats. We believe it is important persuasive speech to find the roots of anger that can be a serious mental health issue or an emotional one.</p>

      <p>We provide our client with a controlled platform for recovery where he learns to release his or her emotions in a positive and constructive way rather than negative and destructive. We encourage them to examine the circumstances that trigger their anger issues and become aware of the same.</p>

      <p>They are taught the signs to identify such situations and a clear road map is made in conjugation with the therapist.</p>

      <p>Regular counselling with anxiety controlling techniques can result in a significant anger management.</p>
      <p>Our therapists will teach you meditation, breathing exercises during tense situations, relaxation strategy and we’ll be building an anger diary to improve self-awareness.</p>

<b>What we do at GCWC ?</b>

<p>Behaviour manifestation is actually tip of the iceberg. It is crucial to know details of the problematic behaviour in terms of its frequency, intensity, precipitating factors, maintaining factors.</p>

<p>More often than not, behaviours could be a part of a disorder or syndrome. The key to changing behaviour is to understand it first. That is where our team of experts including Psychiatrist, Child Psychologist, counsellors come into the picture. They follow a structured format of:</p>


<li>1. Functional Behaviour Analysis</li>
<li>2. Detailed Family History</li>
<li>3. Structured Evaluation to assess the presence of any disorder</li>
<li>4. Engineering Behaviour Modification programme</li>

<p>The usual B.E.S.T (Behaviour and Emotional Structuring Therapy) programme can last anywhere between 6-12 sessions, followed by booster programmes. The booster sessions ensure that the modified behaviour is reinforced and maintained.</p>

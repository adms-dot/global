      <p>We live in a digital age. Time is a luxury for everyone. In our busy lives we find it difficult to leave our work, examples of contrast in literature travel and seek consultation.</p>

<p>GCWC believes that there is nothing that replaces in person consultation. We encourage first consultation as a one on one meeting. Once we are able to assess and make a diagnosis, we formulate a plan and work with the families to extend online consultation and support.</p>

<b>The online consultation would entail</b>

 <li>Feedback and discussion of previously given home plans</li>
 <li>Discussion of any urgent issues</li>
 <li>Support and psycho-education</li>
 <li>Follow up and up gradation of home plans</li>

 <p>We aim at using technology to our advantage, helping the families, assisting them in existing treatment plans; addressing issues, allaying fears and helping them understand problems well. When a child is going through a hard time, a parent may be plagued with worry and anxiety. GCWC has a team of caring experts who are dedicated to extend online support to help answer queries and provide guidance to parents in the comfort of their homes</p>

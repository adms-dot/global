      <b>Psychological Assessment</b>
      <img src={assess} alt="assessment" />

      <p>Psychological assessment is the first step to identify a problem and make a diagnosis.</p>

      <p>At Global Child Wellness Centre , we put emphasis on getting a child assessed fully before starting any kind of therapy. With a team of expert psychologists, all kinds of testing is done and evaluated at the centre. </p>

      <p>An assessment may include observation (general or play ), interviews with the child, interview with the parents, testing and even consultation with other school counsellors, teachers or other allied professionals.</p>

      <p>After getting an assessment, generally it takes 7 to 10 days for a report . This helps to identify your childâ€™s strength and weakness and will lead to recommendations for behaviour as well as academic inputs.</p>

      <p>Dr. Navneet Korpal, MPT (Neurology), A dedicated specialist in pediatric physiotherapy. With a profound focus on enhancing the lives of children, Dr. Korpal brings extensive expertise in managing complex neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), sensory processing disorder, and hyperactivity.</p>

      <b>Cerebral Palsy (CP):</b>

      <p>CP is a group of disorders that affect movement and muscle coordination. It is caused by damage to the developing brain, often before birth.</p>


      <b>Primary Features:</b>
      <p>Motor Problems:</p>
      <p>CP primarily affects movement, causing issues with muscle tone, reflexes, posture, and balance.</p>

      <p>Developmental Milestones:</p>
      <p>Children with CP may experience delays in reaching developmental milestones such as sitting, crawling, walking, and using motor skills.</p>
      <p>Types:</p>
      <p>There are different types of CP depending on the area of the brain affected and the severity of symptoms.</p>

      <b>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):</b>
      <p>ASD is a developmental disorder characterized by challenges with social skills, communication (both verbal and nonverbal), and repetitive behaviors. It is a spectrum disorder, meaning symptoms can range from mild to severe.</p>

      <b>Primary Features:</b>

      <p>Communication Issues:</p>

      <p>Difficulty in understanding and using language, both spoken and nonverbal cues (such as gestures and facial expressions).</p>

      <b>Social Challenges:</b>
      <p>Difficulty in understanding social norms, building relationships, and interpreting social cues.</p>

      <b>Behavioral Patterns:</b>
      <p>Often includes repetitive behaviors (like hand-flapping or rocking) and insistence on routines or rituals.</p>

      <b>Sensory Sensitivities:</b>
      <p>Many individuals with ASD have heightened sensitivities to sensory stimuli (e.g., sound, light, touch).</p>

      <b>Differences between cerebral palsy (CP) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD):</b>

      <b>Focus of Symptoms:</b>
      <p>CP primarily affects motor function and physical movement, whereas ASD primarily affects social communication, behavior, and sensory processing.</p>

      <b>Onset and Diagnosis:</b>
      <p>CP is typically diagnosed early based on motor delays and neurological exams, whereas ASD might be diagnosed later, often around ages 2-3, based on behavioral observations and developmental assessments.</p>

      <b>Causes:</b>

      <p>CP is caused by brain damage before, during, or shortly after birth, whereas the exact causes of ASD are still being researched, but genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role.</p>

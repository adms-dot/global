      <p>At Global Child Wellness Centre, we build programmes for children ranging from 15 months old to 6 years old . This would help them to be either prepare or attend preschool or primary classes. Main focus of this program is:</p>

      <li>Communication difficulty</li>
      <li>Daily living activities</li>
      <li>Fine and gross motor skills</li>
      <li>Social Well being</li>
      <li>Perception of Basic things</li>

      <p>Our therapist utilise an approach which will help the child to better understand his/her strength and weakness. Our Approach is:</p>

      <li>Make a time bound progress chart</li>
      <li>Identify the therapies and individual plan</li>
      <li>Intervention for weak areas</li>
      <li>Helping parents by giving home plans</li>


<p>The Program is taken up by a team which consists of Speech therapist , Occupational Therapist, Special Educator and Child Psychologist. Each child has an individual plan accordingly and is constantly reviewed.</p>
